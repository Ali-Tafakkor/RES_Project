# RES_Project
This file is a Python program code that can be used to easily analyze the Homer software Excel file, which contains a very large volume of hourly parameter data, and draw a graph of the desired parameters.
The main files are the main files, the first one checks the case where we want to display the outputs based on the mid-season day.
The second one checks the case where we use the 24-hour monthly average for the display.

In addition, two Excel files (which are the raw outputs of the Homer program in the same scenario) are included, each of which is a sample input for the main programs so that the working method and output of each can be examined.

To run this program, first download its files or import it into your VSCode using the "git clone" command.
Then enter the following command for each of the cases:
python RES_main_1.py 
or 
python RES_main_2.py
